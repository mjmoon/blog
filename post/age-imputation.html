  <li><strong>Master</strong><br />
Below is a small piece of history on addressing young males from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_&#40;form_of_address&#41;" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> which explains the <code class="highlighter-rouge">age</code> distribution of <em>Masters</em> in the data.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>After its replacement in common speech by Mister, Master was retained as a form of address only for boys who have not yet entered society. By the late 19th century, etiquette dictated that men be addressed as Mister, and boys as Master.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mrs. vs. Ms.</strong><br />
<em>Mrs</em> is used to address married females in general whereas <em>Ms</em> or <em>Miss</em> are  used for young and/or single - females. The difference in age distributions shows that passengers with title <em>Mrs</em> are generally older which aligns with their common usage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Other</strong><br />
The plot shows that passengers with other titles are all adults. These included noble (e.g., <em>Countess</em>) and professional (e.g., <em>Dr</em>) titles.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="impute-by-group">Impute by group</h2>
<p>Knowing that passengers with different titles have different <code class="highlighter-rouge">age</code> distribution, we randomly impute the missing values per <code class="highlighter-rouge">title</code> following the steps below.</p>

<p>Per <code class="highlighter-rouge">title</code>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Calculate mean and standard deviation of <code class="highlighter-rouge">age</code></li>
  <li>Randomly generate <code class="highlighter-rouge">age</code> values between <code class="highlighter-rouge">mean - std</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">mean + std</code></li>
  <li>Assign the randomly generated values to the missing values</li>
</ol>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">ageImputed</span> <span class="o">=</span> \

<p>Within <code class="highlighter-rouge">pandas</code>, we could use <code class="highlighter-rouge">groupby</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">apply</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">fillna</code> together to fill missing values per group. As an example, the code block above imputes with the mean of <code class="highlighter-rouge">age</code> per <code class="highlighter-rouge">title</code>. However, combining <code class="highlighter-rouge">apply</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">fillna</code> can only assign a single value to all missing values within the group. In order to assign random values for each record, we generate an array of random values and assign per group.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<ul>
  <li>By identifying logical groups with similar distributions, the imputation method seems to generate a more realistic data.</li>
  <li>The uniform random generation may be improved by using estimated densities instead</li>
  <li>During model building, it would be interesting to see if the grouped random imputation yields a better result compared using 1) mean imputation, 2) simple random imputation, or the missing value indicator without imputation</li>
</ul>

                <p><p>Recently, I have convinced two of my friends to form a study group on data science. We are planning to follow courses from different online educational platforms such as <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/" target="_blank">DataCamp</a> and <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank">edX</a> while completing projects using data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>. Before we start our first project with <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic" target="_blank">Kaggle’s introductory competition</a>, we walked through the following steps to set up common, collaborative project environments.</p>

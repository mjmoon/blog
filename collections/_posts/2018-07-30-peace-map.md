The interactive map below shows data from a recent [Data for a Cause Challenge](https://www.olgatsubiks.com/data-for-a-cause){:target="_blank"}. The Challenge requests participants to create data visualizations for non-profit organizations. This particular challenge was about presenting the global peace trends.

>  In this Data for a Cause challenge we are taking a closer look at these troubling signs by visualizing global peace trends.  
We used Global Peace Index produced by IEP. The Global Peace Index is considered the standard for measuring peace around the world.

The winners are presented [here](https://www.olgatsubiks.com/single-post/2018/07/05/Winners-of-the-11th-Data-for-a-Cause-Challenge). I didn't complete mine within the time limit and did not make a submission.

### Afterthoughts

+   I used [D3.js](https://d3js.org/){:target="_blank"} a JavaScript library enabling data-driven web pages. I have been enjoying it as it allows more control over the visualization compared to others I used such as R's `ggplot2` and Python's `bokeh` and `plotly`. My code is probably quite sloppy since I am not an experienced JS developer but I was able to play with more complex and customized interactions.
+   This is my first data-driven map I have ever created. I used geographic data from [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/){:target="_blank"}. Picking the colours to present the data on the map probably took the majority of the time. It was challenging to present the numeric values without a physical axis. Looking at other people's visualizations (including the winners') helped.

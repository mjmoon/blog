description: 'Participated in the student case study and poster competition where the objective was to assess association between GFT predictions and actual respiratory illnesses and to construct a prediction model for influenza outbreaks. Developed multiple ARIMA-based times series prediction models and implemented cross-validation algorithms to compare them with dynamic regression models. Also, designed, developed, and presented the final poster presenting the study methods and results using Microsoft PowerPoint and R.'

description: 'Designed a routing system for electric vehicles which presented alternate shortest paths with charging stations en route when needed based on the current battery level of the vehicle. Conducted researches on relevant areas including routing system market, traffic simulations, and battery consumption models. Developed and implemented a shortest path algorithm derived from A* search algorithm in Python which connected to the map database in MongoDB and was presented in an Android app.'

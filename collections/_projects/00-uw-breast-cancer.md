description: 'Designed a breast cancer self-examination aid using pressure sensors detecting abnormally denser areas suggesting signs of potential illness. Conducted researches on relevant areas including socioeconomic imparts of cancers, breast cancer self-examination mechanics and effectiveness, and pressure sensor market. Developed a mechanical prototype using pressure sensors and a decision logic implemented in Arduino and MATLAB based on simulations using a tactile-baed self-examination training module.'

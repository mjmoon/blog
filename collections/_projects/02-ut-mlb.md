description: 'Designed and conducted a study to identify major factors associated with a starting pitcher’s injuries using MLB game-play data available online. Identified and gathered data related to game-play, roster, and disabled lists from multiple sources – approximately 320Mb of data. Joined and cleaned the data using SQL and R by matching teams and player names. Developed a logistic regression model as well as tree-based models including a random forest model to identify the key factors and to build a predictive model for injuries during a season.'
